Java OOP Concepts:

OOP advantages:
-easy to manage
-secure (data hiding)
-simulate real-world event much more effectively

Object-based programming language follows all the features of OOPs except Inheritance. 
JavaScript and VBScript are examples of object-based programming languages.

Static Binding: happens at compile time. Example: Method Overloading
Dynamic Binding: happens at runtime. Example: Method Overriding

Pure virtual function: function that don't have implementations. Example: abstract method in java

Concrete Class: any class has an implementations of its methods (except abstract & interface classes)

UML modeling:
-Generalization (inherit)
-Association (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, many-to-many)
-Composition (part-of), (strong association)
-Aggregation (has-a), (weak association)
-Inheritance "is-a" relationship

Types of inheritance in java:
-Single
-Multilevel
-Hierarchical
-Multiple
-Hybrid

Polymorphism:
-Overloading
-Overriding
-Upcasting

Coupling: Dependency of the classes (class have details of another class).
Cohesion: The class components are related to the class name.
