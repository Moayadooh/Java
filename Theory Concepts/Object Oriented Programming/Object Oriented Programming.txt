https://www.javatpoint.com/java-oops-concepts

Object-based programming language follows all the features of OOPs except Inheritance. 
JavaScript and VBScript are examples of object-based programming languages.

OOP advantages:
-easy to manage
-secure (data hiding)
-simulate real-world event much more effectively

Static Binding happens at compile time.
example: Method Overloading

Dynamic Binding happens at runtime.
example: Method Overriding

Pure virtual function is a function that don't have implementations.
example: An abstract method in Java

UML modeling:
Generalization (inherit)
Association (one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, many-to-many)
Composition (part-of), (strong association)
Aggregation (has-a), (weak association)
